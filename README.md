# EspressoText

My first attempt at writing a functional text editor in C. Currently under Dev, EspressoText 1.1
Call program with one argument. It either opens the text file or writes a new one if it doesn't exist.

Version 1.0 contains:
p : prints 10 lines of a text file
q : quit 
w : write 
a : append
/ : find
h : help

All commands and descriptions can be found by the help command.
